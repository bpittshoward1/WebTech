			<h1> Types of Spearfishing </h1>
			<hr>
			
			<h3> Shallow Water (Reef) Spearfihing  </h3>
			<img src="../images/reef spearfishing.jpg">
			<ol>
                <li class="howard"> Swimming on the Surface:</li>
					<ul>
						<li> While on the surface you must swim quietly, ensure one hand is free to keep contact with the reef and bottom. </li>
					</ul>
                <li class="howard"> Aproaching the Fish: </li>
					<ul>
						<li>  Be vary silent in this procees reef and bottom fish are more skiddish. </li>
					</ul>
				<li class="howard"> Landing the Fish: </li> 
					<ul>
						<li> After making a successful approach, aim and fire. Reef an bottom fish tend to swim straight into holes in the reef so be prepared to land the fish after it has gone into one.
							Understand that you need to keep an eye out for sharks because now they are triggered when they hear the sound of some spearguns. If approached by a shark while fighting a fish 
							be prepared to give up your catch to the "tax collecter". 							
						</li>
					</ul>
			</ol>	
			
			<h3> Bottom Spearfishing </h3>
			<img src="../images/bottom spearfishing.jpg">
			<ol>
                <li class="howard"> Swimming on the Surface:</li>
					<ul>
						<li> While on the surface look for a break in the reeef or a steep ledge, somewhere where you can laydown on the bottom and wait. This style of spearfishing takes a long time to master
							and also requires a longer than normal breath hold. </li>
					</ul>
                <li class="howard"> Diving to the bottom: </li>
					<ul>
						<li> This dive should be the quickest and least energy draining types of dives. This is due to the long time spent at the bottom trying to blend in and wait for the species you are targeting
							to approach.</li>
					</ul>
                <li class="howard"> Landing the Fish: </li> 
					<ul>
						<li> After the fish approaches you in curiosity, aim and fire. At this point you are out of breath, immediately head back to the surface while remaining to keep an eye on your catch that is 
							connected to your line. As like reef fishing, ensure no sharks are present to take your catch. Once at the surface you can contiue fighting the fish at the surface. </li>			
					</ul>
			</ol>	
			
			<h3> Blue Water Spearfishing </h3>
			<img src="../images/Blue water spearfishing.jpg" height="500" width="700">
			<ol>
                <li class="howard"> Swimming on the Surface:</li>
					<ul>
						<li> While on the surface preparing for a dive you must swim quietly, check in with dive partner often, and esure all gear is intact and functining properly. </li>
					</ul>
                <li class="howard"> Diving into the blue abiss: </li>
					<ul>
						<li> Before your initial decient, enusre you are ready for any species of fish because when your in 200 plus feet you never know what you can swim into.</li>
					</ul>
                <li class="howard"> Aproaching the Fish: </li>
					<ul>
						<li> Every fish reacts differently to being approached. However, in all my years of spearfishing, the best tactic if you have never approached a fish is to make limited eye contact and never
							swim directly toward them. Moreover, swimming deaper than required can be easily achieved because there is no bottom in sight for hundreds if not thousands of feet. </li>
					</ul>
				<li class="howard"> Landing the Fish: </li> 
					<ul>
						<li> After making a successful approach, aim and fire. Now things get interesting, when hunting in blue water the fish tend to be larger than reef fish and ten times stronger, 
							the fish will make its first run. Keep your hand on the line and begin fighting the fish. After a long and grouling battle you should have landed your first palegic (blue water)
							fish.							
						</li>
					</ul>
