		<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
		<h3> Into the World of Spearfishing!</h3>
		<hr/>
		<p>
		Would you like to know something you have probably never heard of? This little know secret has begun to gain traction outside the fishing community! 
		Continue reading if you want to know this old school style of fishing that has begun to spread in popularity around the world. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		My website is about a fishing style used in most warm water regions around the world. Spearfishing is a style of fishing used to hunt a targeted species underwater. 
		Though some people use scuba gear, the more traditional method is to free dive. Free diving is a style of underwater fishing. Though some attributes are similar to snorkeling, 
		the main difference is that instead of spending most of your time on the surface looking down you take a big breath using different breathing techniques and drop down to the 
		bottom from the surface. The depths free divers can attain range from novice at 10 feet to advance at 150 feet and beyond. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		While encompassing a wide breath of information this site will shed light on the art of spearfishing. From the different types of hunting styles to the gear used, 
		the user will gain a vast amount of knowledge and will at least peak peoples interest around this old hunting technique. While the age range for spearfishing in general is 
		quite vast, it is mostly concentrated toward teen to young adults. Thus, the types of users that will be attracted to this sight are people curious about spearfishing. 
		The general age range of the users on this site will range from 12-35 with the outliers being boat captains ranging from 30-60.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As for content, it will include general information about spearfishing, different hunting techniques, gear, and contain links to different videos. 
		These videos will highlight people of all ages targeting different species in different regions of the world.
